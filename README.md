## Repository Description

This repository contains final reports from graduate-level coursework projects in Computer, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering disciplines. The reports are formatted as research papers, including references to scholarly literature. Projects were completed either individually or in groups.

## Courses Overview

### COMOP541: Deep Learning
- **Description**: This course delves into the fundamentals of deep learning, with a primary focus on the supervised approach. Some exploration of unsupervised methods is also covered, albeit to a lesser extent.
- **Topics: ANN, CNN, RNN, Transformers 

### ELEC547: Biomedical Signal Processing
- **Description**: In this course, various types of biomedical sensors and their signals are studied, including ECG, EEG, EMG, IMU, among others. The curriculum covers features-based and learning-based techniques, including statistical methods like machine learning.

### COMP548: Medical Imaging
- **Description**: This course covers basic image filtering techniques, including segmentation and clustering, using non-learning-based approaches. It also explores learning-based approaches, including those based on deep learning.

### MECH511: Mechanical Vibration
- **Description**: This course examines single and multi-degree-of-freedom systems, as well as continuous body vibrations, with a specific focus on beams.

### MECH525: Mechanics of Microsensors
- **Description**: This course focuses on interaction of MEMS and NEMS devices and their analysis using FEA tools such as Comsol Multiphysics
