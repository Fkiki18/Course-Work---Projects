This repository contains final reports from Graduate Level (advanced) course work projects. 
The courses include Computer, Mechanical, and Electrical Engineering courses. 
The reports are written in a research paper format including reference to literature papers. 
Some of projects were done indvidually and others were done in a group.

COMOP541 is a Deep-learning course. We study in it the foundation of deep learning and focus mainly on the supervised approach and we explore unsupervised also but to a lesser extent.
ELEC547 is Biomedical Signal Processing course. We study different types of biomedical sensors and their signals including ECG, EEG, EMG, IMU, etc. We explore features-based and learning-based techniques including statistical ones like machine learning  
COMP548 is Medical Imaging. We discuss basic image filtering techniques including segmentation and clustering using non-learning-based approaches. Then we try learning-based approaches including deep learning approaches.
MECH511 is a Mechanical vibration course. We study single and multi degrees of freedom and explore continuous body vibrations focusing on beams.
